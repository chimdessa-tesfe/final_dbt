#This is to create an AI startup that deploys sensors to businesses, collects data from all activities in a business - from people’s interaction to the smart appliances installed in the company to reading environmental and other relevant information. This startup is responsible to install all the required sensors, receive a stream of data from all sensors, and analyse the data to provide key insights to the business. The objective is to reduce the cost of running the client facility as well as to increase the livability and productivity of workers.

Dbt is a data modeling tool that makes the lives of analysts and engineers a whole lot easier. It helps you write SQL queries in a way where you don’t have to worry about dependencies. I like to think of it as splitting queries into containerized blocks of code. It allows you to write SQL code in a way where you don’t have to keep repeating parts of queries that you’ve already written.
